# WardServiceApp

## Overview

Provides lists of wards and departments.

Part of the [HealthSafe](../README.md) project. Independent Maven module, no
parent pom.

MQ: this service subscribes to the ActiveMQ topic `staffing-events-topic` — see [`../common/`](../common) — and publishes to the ActiveMQ queue `equipment-failure-queue` when it detects an equipment failure on one of its wards, consumed by [`../equipment-alert-service`](../equipment-alert-service). Broker URL, topic name, and queue name come from the common `co.wethinkcode.healthsafe.mq.MqConfig` class alongside it in this module.

REST: called by `staffing-service` (`../staffing-service`) and `alert-level-service` (`../alert-level-service`) — see [Integration contracts](../README.md#integration-contracts) in the root README for the endpoint shapes.

## Project structure

## Build

```
mvn package
```

## Run

```
java -jar target/ward-service.jar
```

Listens on port `7031`.

## Endpoints

- `GET /wards` — full list of cleaned ward records, sourced from `ingestion-service`
  at startup (and re-fetched lazily if the cache is empty, e.g. ingestion-service
  wasn't up yet).
- `GET /wards/{id}` — a single ward by ID (case-insensitive), `404` if unknown.
- `GET /departments` — sorted list of distinct department names.

## Test

No automated tests yet. Manually verify it's up (start `ingestion-service` first):

```
curl http://localhost:7031/health       # -> OK
curl http://localhost:7031/wards        # -> cleaned ward records
curl http://localhost:7031/wards/W-01   # -> single record, or 404 if unknown
curl http://localhost:7031/departments  # -> distinct department names
```

To add real tests, add JUnit 5 + the Surefire plugin to `pom.xml`, put tests under
`src/test/java/co/wethinkcode/healthsafe/`, and run `mvn test`.
